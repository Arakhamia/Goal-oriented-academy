                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India.<br>
                     It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark,<br>
                      hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. adult male lions are larger<br>
                       than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.<br>
                        A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female <br>
                        lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and <br>
                        keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been <br>
                        known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

                        <aside>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands.<br>
                             It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when<br>
                              persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.</aside>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common
                     ancestor of the Felidae around 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75 to 0.97
                      million years ago. Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship 
                      of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar that diverged 
                      3.46 to 1.22 million years ago, but also with the leopard that diverged 3.1 to
                       1.95 million years ago to 4.32 to 0.02 million years ago. Hybridisation between 
                       lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years
                        ago. The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic
                         since at least the early Pliocene. The earliest fossils recognisable as lions 
                         were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million
                          years old.</p>
