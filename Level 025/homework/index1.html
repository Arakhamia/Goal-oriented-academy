                <h2>Life</h2>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest<br>
                     living cat species native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a <br>
                     large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical <br>
                     stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though<br>
                      some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers <br>
                      of the Sunda Islands.<br><br>
                    
                      Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and<br>
                       temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China<br>
                        to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent<br>
                         and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, <br>
                         which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, <br>
                         defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps<br>
                          with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually <br>
                          two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming<br>
                           independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.</p>

                        <aside>Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of <br>
                            their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, <br>
                            in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's<br>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>During friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other's bodies. Facial 
                    expressions include the "defence threat", which involves a wrinkled face, bared teeth,
                     pulled-back ears and widened pupils. Both males and females show a flehmen response,
                      a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings. Males also use the
                       flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Tigers will move their
                        ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters 
                        and between mothers and cubs. They also use their tails to signal their mood.
                         To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive
                          tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side. When calm, the tail hangs low</p>
