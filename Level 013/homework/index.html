    <h1>Python</h1>

    <p><strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.<br>
         Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br><br>
        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming<br>
         paradigms, including structured(particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional<br>
          programming. It is often described as a "batteries included"language due to its<br>
           comprehensive standard library.<br><br>

        <em>Guido van Rossum</em> began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC<br>
         programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0<br>
          was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely<br>
           backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the<br>
            last release of Python 2.<br><br>
        
        Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained<br>
         widespread use in the machine learning community.For more information
