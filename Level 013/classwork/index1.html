    <h2>Html</h2>

    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
         It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
          (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
             web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
             <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as<br>
                 interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
                  by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<br>
                   HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly
                    introduce content into the page. Other tags such as p and /p surround and provide information about document<br>
                     text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the

                      content of the page.For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">click here.</a></p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document<br>
         written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
          cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
             This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and <br>
             control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
              by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural<br>
               content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the 
               file and its formatting.</p>

               <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different<br>
                 styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or 
                 screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content<br>

                  is accessed on a mobile device.For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">click here.</a></p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
         99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
          Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some<br>
           servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
           JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. <br>
           It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces<br>
             (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
              (DOM).</p>

              <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br>
                 In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                 Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages<br>

                  are distinct and differ greatly in design.For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">click here.</a></p>
