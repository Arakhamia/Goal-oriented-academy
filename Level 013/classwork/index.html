   <h2>Football</h2>


   <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified,<br>
     the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
      Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa,<br>
       the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football;
        gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football;<br>
         rugby league football; and rugby union football. These various forms of football share, to varying degrees,
          common origins and are known as "football codes".</p><br>

          <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts<br>
             of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at 
             English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football. The expansion and<br>
              cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside
               the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:<br>
                Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in 
                order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first<br>
                 of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football
                  grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.For more information

    <h2>Basketball</h2>

    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,<br>
         compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
          through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each <br>
          end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
           unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled<br>
            or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points 
            at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime)<br>
             is mandated</p><br>

             <p>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate,<br>
                 both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots - the layup, the jump shot,
                  or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense <br>
                  or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation
                   to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands<br>
                    then resume dribbling.For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">click here.</a></p>

    <h2>Rugby</h2>

    <p>Rugby union football, commonly known simply as rugby union or more often just rugby, is a close-contact team sport that<br>
         originated at Rugby School in England in the first half of the 19th century. Rugby is simply based on running with the
          ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an oval-shaped ball<br>
           on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.
         Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by people regardless of gender, age or size. In 2023,<br>
          there were more than 10 million people playing worldwide, of whom 8.4 million were registered players. World Rugby,
           previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been<br>

            the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 116 countries as full members and 18 associate members.</p>
            <p>In 1845, the first laws were written by students attending Rugby School; other significant events in the early <br>
                development of rugby include the decision by Blackheath F.C. to leave The Football Association in 1863 and,
                 in 1895, the split between rugby union and rugby league. Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in<br>
                  1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest 

                  level for the first time.For more information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union">click here.</a></p>
