    <h1>Football</h1>

    <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,<b> kicking a ball to score a goal.</b>
         Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.<br>
          Sports commonly called football <i>include association football </i><br>
          (known as <u>soccer</u> in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);<br>
           Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football,
            arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football;<br>
             and rugby union football. These various forms of football share, to varying degrees,
              common origins and are known as <strong>"football codes"</strong>.<br>

            There are a number of references to traditional, ancient,
             or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.<br>
             Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
              English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.<br>
               The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to
               areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.<em> By the end of the 19th century, <br>
               distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for exam In 1888, the Football League was
                 founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations.</em> During the 20th century,<br>
                  several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>
