    <h1>Computer programming</h1>

    <p><b>Computer</b> programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called <i>programs</i>,<br>
         that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms,
          step-by-step specifications of procedures,<br> by writing code in one or more programming languages.
           <u>Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible</u><br> to humans than machine code,
            which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several<br>
             different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code 
             libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.<br>

     <strong>Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, <br>
     debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts,<br>
      such as programs' machine code.</strong> While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used<br>
       for this larger overall process - with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing<br>
        of code per se. <em>Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods<br>
         or follows an engineering design process.</em></p>
