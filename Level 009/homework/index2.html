<h2>Mamardashvili</h2>

<p>Giorgi Mamardashvili is my favourite player from our team.
(Georgian: გიორგი მამარდაშვილი, romanized: giorgi mamardashvili; born 29 September 2000) 
is a Georgian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for La Liga club Valencia and the Georgia national team.
Mamardashvili spent much of his youth years at Dinamo Tbilisi. After signing a professional contract with this club,
he was loaned to other Erovnuli Liga teams for three seasons before his transfer to Valencia.
He has quickly established himself as a first-choice shot-stopper, becoming the first ever Georgian goalkeeper in the Spanish top tier.</p>

<h2>Kvaratskhelia</h2>

<p>Khvicha "Kvara" Kvaratskhelia (Georgian: ხვიჩა კვარაცხელია; born 12 February 2001)[4] is a Georgian professional footballer who plays 
as a winger for Serie A club Napoli and the Georgia national team.
Kvaratskhelia started his senior career playing for Dinamo Tbilisi at age 16,
before departing to Rustavi where he spent half a season. During his combined three-year tenure at Lokomotiv Moscow and Rubin Kazan,
Kvaratskhelia won two consecutive Russian Premier League Best Young Player awards. Following a short spell at Dinamo Batumi,
Kvaratskhelia signed for Napoli in 2022, and in his debut season helped the club to reach the quarter-final of the
UEFA Champions League for the first time ever, and win a first Serie A title in 33 years, finishing as the league's top assist
provider. This saw him named Serie A Most Valuable Player and the Champions League's Young Player of the Season.
Widely regarded as one of the best Georgian players of all time, Kvaratskhelia established himself for Georgia in all
national youth teams, becoming a key player under different managers. He then became an integral part of the senior
team after making his debut in 2019, and helped Georgia qualify for UEFA Euro 2024, the country's first ever major
international tournament.</p>
